  ## Description:

 An inspiring bullet journal for the digital age.

Zen App is built on a NodeJS backend, with Express for server/routing, Sequelize for database handling, Handlebars for views, and is hosted on Heroku. It makes use of two external APIs, which are called once a day to build an image/quote pairing. 

Users (authenticated via Passport with password encryption by bCrypt.js) have the option to write short reflections on the quotes they find inspiring, and can make use of a daily checklist in the app or look at past reflections.

This project was initially built in Sept. 2020 over 10 days by 5 people.
